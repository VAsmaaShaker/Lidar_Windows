My team of interns and I used Lidar on Windows to explore smart applications, such as self-driving cars and robots. I will explain what we accomplished at Smart Methods Inc.

## What is LIDAR?
LIDAR is a method of using focused light beams to detect distant objects. It works very much like RADAR and in fact the mnemonic ‚ÄúLIDAR‚Äù was initially a fusion of the words ‚ÄúRADAR‚Äù (Radio Detection And Ranging) and ‚ÄúLight‚Äù.

## Implementation Steps
### Launch Lidar on Windows  
1. I downloaded the program through the following link: [Lidar App](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1269MVQ1uHXF1hAg3xkz5vmfc5Uqj7rIh/view?usp=sharing)
2. I opened the Delta-A2 folder, alternatively Delta-A1.

3. I connected PORT Signal to Lidar and another port to the laptop.
- PORT Signal
